# pin-check

**This is a work in progress for now!**

The pin-check will be a PCB for hand-wired keyboards that uses all through-hole components. It is inspired by the [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid), [Discipline](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline), and [Postage Board](https://github.com/LifeIsOnTheWire/Postage-Board/blob/master/README.md).
