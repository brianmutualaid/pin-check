# Overview
<a name="overview" />

The pin-check is a printed circuit board (PCB) for hand-wired keyboards that uses all through-hole components, and supports [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/), MX or Alps keyswitches, and split layouts. The keyswitch spacing is 19.05 mm and the USB connector is USB-C.

It is inspired by the [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid), [Discipline](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline), and [Postage Board](https://github.com/LifeIsOnTheWire/Postage-Board/blob/master/README.md). It's called the pin-check because pin check is a smaller pattern than plaid and [Gingham](https://yiancar-designs.com/product/gingham/). It will stick up above your case or plate, both to show off the components ðŸ˜Ž and because through-hole components can't fit under the keyswitches on the back side of the PCB like the surface-mount device (SMD) components of something like Postage Board can.

It looks something like this (before any of the components are added).

Kits that include the PCB and all components (except for keyswitches) may be for sale at some point.

# DIY
<a name="diy" />

**If you purchased a kit you can [skip to building the kit](#building-the-kit)!**

## PCB
<a name="pcb" />

To get a PCB, you can submit the files in this repository to any PCB manufacturer. [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) lets you upload `.kicad_pcb` files directly, or you can generate Gerber and drill files and submit them to your preferred PCB manufacturer (the manufacturer should have instructions to do this using [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/)).

## Components
<a name="components" />

All of the required electrical components and quantities are listed in the [bill of materials (BOM)](bom.md). You can purchase these components (or equivalent components) from DigiKey, Mouser, or anywhere else you can find them. The BOM does not include parts like keyswitches or keycaps.

## Bootloader
<a name="bootloader" />

To flash new QMK keyboard layouts onto the keyboard (without using an AVR programmer or the ISP pins), the bootloader on the ATmega328P microcontroller unit (MCU) needs to support USB. [USBaspLoader](https://github.com/baerwolf/USBaspLoader) is bootloader for AVR MCUs that uses [V-USB](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html) for USB support.

TODO: Add instructions to use avrdude with either an AVR programmer or Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to flash the bootloader onto a fresh chip/MCU.

## Acrylic Window
<a name="acrylic-window" />

If you want to mount a clear acrylic window above the exposed portion of the PCB, you can upload the `assets/window.svg` file in this repository to your preferred laser cutting service or use it to cut a piece of clear acrylic yourself (something around 3mm thick should be good). To mount the window, you need four M2 female-female standoffs that are at least 10 mm long, and eight M2 screws to secure the standoffs to the window and the PCB.

# Building the Kit
<a name="building-the-kit" />

There will be instructions here for assembling the kit (soldering components onto the PCB).

# Designing a Keyboard
<a name="designing-a-keyboard" />

If you already have a plate, case, and keyswitches, and are familiar with hand-wiring, you can [skip to the QMK section](#qmk).

TODO: Add information about limitations of the number of I/O pins on the ATmega328P (and implications for layouts).

TODO: Add example instructions of designing and purchasing a plate (probably using [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/), [swillkb](http://builder.swillkb.com/), and [OSH Cut](https://app.oshcut.com/) or another laser cutting service.

TODO: Add information about standoffs and screws for a sandwich-style case.

TODO: Add information about hand-wiring and required parts (more diodes!).

# QMK
<a name="qmk" />

TODO: Add instructions about creating a keymap in QMK and flashing it onto the keyboard. Mention that H11 and H12 are not available to use for rows or columns if you're setting up a split keyboard!

There are a few different configuration options and combinations for using the pin-check for a split keyboard, or using it to support layouts that require more than 17 I/O pins. This table should hopefully cover most use cases and explain the usage of I2C in each case. The pin-check board alone has 18 I/O pins. If you use the TRRS jack (for a split keyboard) or I2C headers (to attach another device like the port expander with I2C), pins `C4` and `C5` are used for I2C and are unavailable for I/O.

| Keyboard | Split | Boards/kits required | I/O pins available | Notes/caveats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4x12 or 5x12 ortholinear | No | 1 pin-check | 18 | Pins `C4` and `C5` are used for I/O, so I2C with TRRS jack or I2C headers can not be used |
| 4x12, 5x12, 6x20 (ðŸ¤·) ortholinear | Yes | 2 pin-checks | 16 per half | Pins `C4` and `C5` are used for I2C, so they are not available for I/O |
| 60% keyboard | No | 1 pin-check and 1 pin-check expansion | 24 | Pins `C4` and `C5` are used for I2C, so they are not available for I/O. Can be done without the expansion board with some creative wiring of a 5x13 matrix |
| Tenkeyless | No | 1 pin-check and 1 pin-check expansion | 24 | Does require some slight creative wiring to create a 7 row by 17 column matrix (instead of 7x18) |

* Thank you to [coseyfannitutti](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti) who designed the [Discipline PCB](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) for the footprints `D_DO-35_SOD27_P5.08mm_Horizontal.kicad_mod` and `USB_C_GCT_USB4085.kicad_mod`! [The Creative Commons license for these is included here](LICENSE.CFTKB).
* Thanks to [ai03-2725](https://github.com/ai03-2725) for the symbol `MX-NoLED` (which I slightly modified to swap the `ROW` and `COL` labels) and footprint `MX-1U-NoLED.kicad_mod` from the [MX_Alps_Hybrid repository](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid). The footprint is also slightly modified (I added F.Mask to the technical layers of pads 1 and 2, so it would show up accurately in Pcbnew's 3D viewer) from the version in [dsanchezseco's pull request](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid/pull/15). [The MIT license for these is included here](LICENSE.ai03).
* The symbol `SJ-43514` and footprint `CUI_SJ-43514.kicad_mod` are from [CUI Devices](https://www.cuidevices.com/product/resource/pcbfootprint/sj-43514) (with minor modifications to the footprint to move some weird edge cuts to the Cmts.User layer). These files are not licensed by CUI Devices and are free to use.
* Lastly, I have to shout out the [plaid PCB](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid) by [hsgw](https://github.com/hsgw) one more time, because it was my first through-hole kit, it inspired me to learn more about circuit and PCB design, and it has been a great resource to learn from since it's open source.
